## 📌 Overview

You are facing a **live infected Windows machine** with suspicious processes, unknown network connections, and potential data exfiltration. Your task is to **collect forensic evidence without missing critical artifacts or contaminating the system**.

The **DFIR Windows Acquisition Playbook** is your guide. It provides a structured and repeatable approach to forensic acquisition, helping investigators systematically collect evidence from compromised Windows systems while preserving integrity and avoiding contamination.

This playbook ensures you know exactly what to collect, in what order, and why it matters during an active incident response.

## 🎯 Objectives

This playbook provides a **standardized DFIR acquisition workflow** to:

- Preserve **volatile evidence first (memory, live data)**
- Collect **disk-level forensic images**
- Extract **Windows artifacts (logs, registry, persistence)**
- Recover **user and attacker activity traces**
- Enable **timeline reconstruction of the incident**
- Support **incident response and forensic investigation**
